    <h1>Testing my SSH connection</h1>
    <h2>Blog Idea</h2>
    <p>How difficult it was to figure out how to add a SSH key to GitHub.  And using Git Bash/Windows</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Added a Config File to SSH Folder</h2>
    <p>Apparently need to tell GitHub to look in the known hosts file.</p>

    <p>Had to let it run through GH one more time and then hopefully it should be fixed"</p>
