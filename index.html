                    <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>I spent my childhood in Japan before moving to the U.S.  From Louisiana I moved to the Pacific Northwest, and then after a bit of back and forth I now call Seattle, Washington a home close to my heart.  
                            I first pursued a degree in International Studies and Foreign Languages before later earning a degree in Wine Marketing & Sales.  
                            My wine journey led me to earn several accolades including becoming a Certified Sommelier with the Court of Master Sommeliers.

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>As the wine bar I was employed at for 7 years was closing down for good and I passed my Spanish Wine Scholar exam with highest honors, I began to think about my next career move.
                            I wanted to put effort towards something that would ignite my imagination, challenge me and offer me the potential for growth and flexibility.
                            On the one hand, I considered a segeway from Marketing and going into UX/UI design.  On the other hand,  I've grown to love mobile apps and have a couple ideas of my own.
                            I'm also a very hands-on person and love learning why things work the way they do, so I dove into Software Engineering.
